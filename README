Destription
-----------

Many universities use EZProxy to allow its students access to various online
databases.  This extension adds a button to Chrome which allows for a quick way
to reload the current page through your EZProxy system.

All it does is pass the URL to your library's EZProxy login URL.  For example:
    http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/
would change to:
    http://www.library.drexel.edu/cgi-bin/r.cgi?url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org
